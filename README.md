# Code Challenges Repository

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from platforms such as **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and others. Solutions are written primarily in **Python** and **C++**, with the potential to expand to other languages over time.

In addition to final solutions, I include failed attempts, error logs, and step-by-step debugging notes to document my thought process and learning journey.
